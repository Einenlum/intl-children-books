This website offers a list of free resources to read a book for children while it is read by a native, in multiple languages.

This type of material can take an interesting place in your journey to learn a new language [like a kid would do](https://takelessons.com/blog/learning-a-foreign-language-adults/). Children get a lot of information from the tone of voice and intonation while someone reads a story to them. Repeating frequently the same stories while showing them the written sentences allow them to grasp how sentences are built and give them progressively a natural sense of how people speak.
